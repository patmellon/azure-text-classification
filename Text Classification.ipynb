To better understand the nature of these universal horizons, we first modify the ray tracing method, and then use it to study their surface gravity in charged Einstein-aether black hole spacetime. Instead of the previous result by Cropp et al., our results show that the surface gravity of the universal horizon is dependent on the specific dispersion relation, kUH = 2(z - 1) k(uh)/z, where z denotes the power of the leading term in the superluminal dispersion relation, characterizing different species of particles.

Design/methodology/approach - The literature indicates that there is no consensus on a standard definition of transaction costs in the construction industry. A detailed literature review of research work on transaction costs in construction is conducted in order to identify the determinants of transaction costs in construction projects. A structural equation model is tested on data collected by means of a survey administered to construction owners. Findings - The findings indicate that the transaction costs borne by the owner can be minimized if the owner minimizes the uncertainties inherent in the construction project by making sure the engineering design is as complete as possible before bids are sought from contractors; harmonious relationships between project participants; fair risk allocation; have experience in similar type projects; and contractor selection practices that routinely detect irregular behavior. Research limitations/implications - The data used in this research are primarily based on the experiences of public owners and the markets in which they operate; a larger representation of private owners could make the conclusions more general. Another limitation of the study is that it relies on a survey of opinions rather than actual records of costs and other hard data. Practical implications - No empirical study has ever been conducted of transaction-related issues in the construction industry because of the lack of a common understanding of transaction cost.

The survey results showed a high degree of agreement among the perceptions of project stakeholders, clients, contractors, and consultants on the causes of project delay, and there is no evidence to suggest that the causes of project delay differ significantly according to organization size or organizational ownership. Moreover, seven factors were identified as the major causes of project delay. Although six of these identified elements are general factors that can account for delay in any project in any industry, one of thempoor interaction with vendors in the engineering and procurement stagesis found to be unique to construction projects in the oil and gas industry.

The clear-cut Co3O4 nanocubes of uniform size were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and characterized with XRD, RS, HR-TEM, XRF, TPSR (CH4/O-16/18(2)), and SSITKA (CH4/O-16/18(2)) techniques. The experimental results were corroborated by first-principles thermodynamic and DFT+U molecular modeling, providing a rational framework for a detailed understanding of the origin of a different redox comportment of the catalyst with the varying temperature and its mechanistic implications. Three temperature/conversion stages of the methane oxidation reaction were distinguished, depending on involvement of the adsorbed or lattice oxygen and the redox state of the catalyst. A stoichiometric (100) surface region (300 degrees C < T < 450 degrees C, X-CH4 < 25%) is featured by the dominant suprafacial (Langmuir-Hinshelwood) mechanism of methane oxidation. A region of slightly defected surface (450 degrees C < T < 650 degrees C, 25%80%), the oxygen vacancies are only partially refilled, the catalyst is significantly reduced, and methane is combusted according to the Mars van Krevelen scheme. Molecular modeling revealed that the suprafacial Co-O-ads adoxygen species are more active (Delta E-a = 0.83 eV) than the intrafacial Co-O-surf surface sites (Delta E-a = 1.11 eV) in the CH4 oxidation. The (100) surface state diagrams for the three distinguished conversion regions were constructed to elucidate the catalyst thermodynamic behavior under those conditions. It was shown that the activity of cobalt spinel is maintained by redox autotuning of the catalyst and dynamic adjustment of uneven participation of the suprafacial and intrafacial oxygen species in methane oxidation to the actual reaction conditions. These factors have important structural and mechanistic consequences for the catalytic CH4 combustion on cobalt spinel and related systems, controlling not only the sustainable versus the stoichiometric turnovers but also for the prevalence or coexistence of the Langinuir-Hinshelwood and the Mars van Krevelen mechanisms with the reaction progress.',\n",

The presence of PDOPA layer between rGO and PVDF can not only prevent the agglomeration and direct contact of original rGOs but also enhance the interaction between PVDF and rGO and microcapacitor formation. Compared to rGO/PVDF composites, higher dielectric permittivity and lower loss factor were achieved simultaneously in rGO@PDOPA/PVDF nanocomposites at low and moderate frequencies.

PAFs were then applied to estimates of expenditure, inflated to 2014-15 Australian dollars, projected over the life course, according to a baseline age of incident cases for child maltreatment in 2012-13, and discounted at 7% per annum. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using a best and lower bound estimate of incidence of child abuse. The best estimate of the total estimated lifetime financial costs for incident cases of child maltreatment in 2012-13 was $9.3 billion (a cost per child maltreated of $176,437), with a lower bound of $5.8 billion. The best estimate of lifetime costs associated with reduced quality of life and premature mortality (non-financial costs) for all incident cases of child maltreatment in 2012-13 was $17.4 billion, or $328,757 per child maltreated.

Methods: A field study was conducted where 100 patient visits were observed and video recorded in a primary care clinic. Videos were then coded for gaze behaviors where patients' and physicians' gaze at each other and artifacts such as electronic health records were coded using a pre-established objective coding scheme. Gaze data were then analyzed using lag sequential methods. Results: Results showed that there are several eye gaze patterns significantly dependent to each other. All doctor-initiated gaze patterns were followed by patient gaze patterns. Some patient-initiated gaze patterns were also followed by doctor gaze patterns significantly unlike the findings in previous studies. Health information technology appears to contribute to some of the new significant patterns that have emerged.

This paper examines the barriers that discourage teachers from reporting child maltreatment and also whether teachers consider it necessary to question a child about the maltreatment before they decide if a report should be made. Thirty semi-structured interviews with Victorian primary school teachers were thematically analysed and revealed that inadequate and inconsistent mandatory reporting training, the need for certainty before initiating a report and the ambiguous concept of neglect were barriers to teachers identifying and reporting child maltreatment. Analyses further revealed that teachers gather evidence to confirm or disconfirm their suspicions of maltreatment by questioning the suspected child victim. The consequences of this practice are discussed along with recommendations to help overcome the barriers to making a formal report when child maltreatment is suspected.',\n",

The piston and cylinder are thermally insulated so that no energy is lost by heat transfer to the surroundings. If the piston is set into motion, it oscillates like a block on a spring. However, the motion is damped because the gas density and pressure immediately adjacent to the piston are higher or lower than the bulk values, depending on whether the piston is compressing or expanding the gas, respectively. That automatically gives rise to a drag force linear in the velocity of the piston. It is not necessary to add extra dissipative terms such as kinetic friction between the piston and cylinder, or viscosity of the gas, to damp out the motion of the piston.

The design of the ORC, the kind of heat source and the ambient condition has an influence on the performance of the Organic Rankine Cycle and on the selection of the working fluid. It can come to a discrepancy between the best candidate from the thermodynamic point of view and the transformation into a real machine design. If an axial turbine design is considered for expansion and energy conversion within the ORC, the vapor volume flow ratios within the expansion path, the pressure ratio and of course the number of stages have to be considered within the fluid selection process and for the design parameters. Furthermore, environmental aspects have to be taken into account, e.g. the global warming potential (GWP) and the flammability of the selected fluid. This paper shows the results of the design and fluid selection process for an Organic Rankine Cycle for application in a combined operation with a 2MW class industrial gas turbine. The gas turbine contains two radial compressor stages with an integrated intercooler. To further increase the thermal cycle efficiency, a recuperator has been implemented to the gas turbine cycle, which uses the exhaust gas waste heat to preheat the compressed air after the second compressor, before it enters the combustion chamber. The shaft power is generated by a three stage axial turbine, whereby the first stage is a convection cooled stage, due to a turbine inlet temperature of 1100 degrees C. To further increase the electrical efficiency and the power output of the energy conversion cycle, a combined operation with an organic Rankine cycle is intended. Therefore the waste heat from the GT compressor intercooler is used as first heat source and the waste heat of the exhaust gas after the recuperator as second heat source for the Organic Rankine Cycle. It is intended that the ORC fluid acts as heat absorption fluid within the compressor intercooler. Due to these specifications for the ORC, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been performed to determine the optimal design parameter and the best working fluid for the ORC, in order to obtain a maximum power output of the combined cycle. Due to the twice coupling of the ORC to the GT cycle, the heat exchange between the two cycles is bounded by each other and a detailed analysis of the coupled cycles is necessary. E.g. the ambient temperature has an enormous influence on the transferred heat from the intercooler to the ORC cycle, which itself affects the heat transfer and temperatures of the transferable heat from the second heat source. Thus, a detailed analysis by considering the ambient operation conditions has been performed, in order to provide a most efficient energy conversion system over a wide operation range. The performance analysis has shown that by application of an ORC for a combined operation with the intercooled and recuperated gas turbine, the combined cycle efficiency can be increased, for a wide ambient conditions range, by more than 3 %pts. and the electrical power output by more than 10 %, in comparison to the stand alone intercooled and recuperated gas turbine.',\n",

However, the droplets have the Wenzel state on the patterned surfaces with small height and radii nanopillars and have the Cassie-Baxter state when the height and radii of nanopillars are large. Furthermore, the intuitive phase diagrams of the wetting states of the droplet in the space of surface geometrical parameters are obtained. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental observations and reveal physical mechanisms involved in the effects of nanopatterned surfaces on wetting states, which implies that these studies may provide useful guidance to the conscious design of patterned surfaces to control the wetting states of droplets.',\n",

This study investigated both the prevalence of child maltreatment by parents among migrant families, and the individual, family and community-level risk factors associated with child abuse in this context. A survey was conducted with 667 migrant and 496 local adolescents in Shenzhen, South China, with a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare the prevalence of maltreatment between migrant and local adolescents, and also to explore risk factors associated with the psychological and physical maltreatment in both groups. The results showed that parent-to-child abuse was more prevalent among migrant than local adolescents, with migrant adolescents 1.490 and 1.425 times more likely to be psychologically and physically abused by their parents than their local counterparts. Low academic performance, delinquent behavior, family economic adversity and low parent attachment put migrant adolescents at increased risk of both psychological and physical maltreatment, and neighborhood disorganization was significantly related to psychological aggression among migrant adolescents. The findings confirm that child abuse perpetuated by parents is a serious problem in Mainland China, especially among migrant families, and implications for policy and practice are discussed.

The environmental performance of hospitals has been enhanced through, for example, green building, waste and energy management, and product design. However, unpredictable occupant behaviour, new research outcomes and evolving best practice requires healthcare to react and respond in an ever challenging and changing environment, and clearly there is no one set of actions appropriate in all jurisdictions. Many authors have pointed up negative environmental impacts caused by healthcare, but these studies have focused on particular aspects of mitigation in isolation, and are for this reason not optimal. Here it is argued that tackling impact mitigation through a whole system approach is likely to be more effective. To illustrate what this approach might entail in practice, an evaluation of a systematic implementation of impact mitigation in Ireland's largest teaching hospital, Cork University Hospital is presented. This approach brings together voluntary initiatives in particular those emanating from governmental and non-governmental organisations, peer supports and the adaptation of programmes designed originally for environmental education purposes. Specific measures and initiatives are described, and analysis of results and planned future actions provides a basis for evaluation of successes achieved in achieving mitigation objectives. A crucial attribute of this approach is that it retains its flexibility and connectivity through time, thereby ensuring continual responsiveness to evolving regulation and best practice in green healthcare. It is demonstrated that implementation in Cork resulted both in mitigation of existing impacts, but also a commitment to continual improvement. For such a systems approach to be widely adopted, the healthcare sector needs both leadership from regulators and stakeholders, and strong supports. In Cork it was found that environmental education programmes, especially action and reward based programmes, as utilised by the campus's academic affiliates in particular University College Cork, were especially effective as a framework to address sustainability challenges and should be developed further. However, within healthcare implementation of environmental initiatives must prioritise patient safety. This approach has now been adopted for delivery across the health services sector in Ireland.

Enzymes offer a particularly promising opportunity to pursue this question, because many enzymes\\' contributions to organismal fitness depend on a comparatively small number of experimentally accessible properties. Moreover, on first principles the demands of enzyme thermostability stand in opposition to the demands of catalytic activity. This observation, coupled with the fact that enzymes are only marginally thermostable, motivates the widely held hypothesis that mutations conferring functional improvement require compensatory mutations to restore thermostability. Here, we explicitly test this hypothesis for the first time, using four missense mutations in TEM-1 beta-lactamase that jointly increase cefotaxime Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) similar to 1500-fold. First, we report enzymatic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) and thermostability (T-m, and thence Delta G of folding) for all combinations of these mutations. Next, we fit a quantitative model that predicts MIC as a function of k(cat)/K-M and Delta G. While k(cat)/K-M explains similar to 54% of the variance in cefotaxime MIC (similar to 92% after log transformation), Delta G does not improve explanatory power of the model. We also find that cefotaxime MIC rises more slowly in k(cat)/K-M than predicted. Several explanations for these discrepancies are suggested. Finally, we demonstrate substantial sign epistasis in MIC and k(cat)/K-M, and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes, in spite of near numerical additivity in the system. Thus constraints on selectively accessible trajectories, as well as limitations in our ability to explain such constraints in terms of underlying mechanisms are observed in a comparatively \"well-behaved\" system.',\n",

The state-of-the-art action recognition methods utilize dense sampled trajectories to build feature representations. However, their performances are limited due to action region clutters and camera motions in real world applications. No matter how the scenario changes in different backgrounds, the salient cues of actions are highly dependent on their appearances and motions. Based on this discovery, in this paper we propose a novel saliency-based dense sampling strategy named improved dense trajectories (iDT) on salient region-based contrast boundary (iDT-RCB). Without any external human detector, a robust mask is generated to overcome the limitations of global contrast based saliency in action sequences. Warped optical flow is exploited to adjust the interest points sampling to remove subtle motions. We show that an appropriate pruning of feature points can achieve a good balance between saliency and density of the sampled points. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. More specifically, the fusion of deep-learned features and our hand-crafted features can even improve the recognition performance over baseline dense sampling methods. In particular, the fusion scheme achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy at 73.8% and 94.8% on Hollywood2 and UCF50, respectively.',\n",

Therefore, strategies incorporating genetic engineering and stem cell biology might have a tremendous potential to treat critical injuries and diseases. Therefore, we modified BMSCs to overexpress the BMP-7 gene (BMP-7-BMSCs) by lentivirus transduction, and then evaluated whether fibrotic processes were inhibited by these cells in vivo. Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, silica, BMSCs, and BMP-7-BMSCs. The control group received saline, the silica group received silica and saline, the BMSCs group received silica and BMSCs, and the BMP-7-BMSCs group received silica and BMP-7-BMSCs. Rats were sacrificed on days 15 or 30 after silica instillation. Hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson's trichrome staining were performed for histological examination. The severity of fibrosis was evaluated by the levels of hydroxyproline, fibronectin (FN), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1. Restoration of the alveolar epithelium was detected by the epithelial marker surfactant protein (SP)-C and aquaporin (AQP)-5. Histopathological results showed that BMP-7-BMSCs could remarkably block the progression of silica-induced fibrosis. Hydroxyproline, FN, and TGF-beta 1 contents in the BMP-7-BMSCs-treated group were significantly lower than those in the BMSCs group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression of SP-C and AQP-5 in the BMP-7-BMSCs-treated group was significantly higher than those in the BMSCs group (P< 0.05). In conclusion, the pulmonary fibrosis induced by silica in rats was significantly reduced by treatment with BMP-7-BMSCs and BMSCs. The anti-fibrotic effect of BMSCs can be strengthened by BMP-7. Treatment with BMP-7-BMSCs might be a potential therapeutic intervention for silicosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\",\n",

Research Methods and Procedures: Forty-six women, ages 28 to 80, BMI 26 to 37 kg/m(2), followed a 12-week 750-kcal/d energy-deficit diet containing higher protein (HP, 30% protein) or normal protein (NP, 18% protein) and were retrospectively subgrouped according to obesity classification [pre-obese (POB), BMI = 26 to 29.9 kg/m(2); obese (OB), BMI = 30 to 37 kg/m(2)). Results: All subjects lost weight, fat mass, and lean body mass (LBM; p < 0.001). With comparable weight loss, LBM losses were less in HP vs. NP (-1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. - 2.8 +/- 0.5 kg; p < 0.05) and POB vs. OB (-1.2 +/- 0.3 vs. -2.9 +/- 0.4 kg; p < 0.005). The main effects of protein and obesity on LBM changes were independent and additive; POB-HP lost less LBM vs. OB-NP (p < 0.05). The energy-restriction-induced decline in satiety was less pronounced in HP vs. NP (p < 0.005). Perceived pleasure increased with HP and decreased with NP (p < 0.05). Lipid-lipoprotein profile and blood pressure improved and kidney function minimally changed with energy restriction (p < 0.05), independently of protein intake. Discussion: Consuming a higher-protein diet and accomplishing weight loss before becoming obese help women preserve LBM. Use of a higher-protein diet also improves perceptions of satiety and pleasure during energy restriction.',\n",

Its formation and function are essential in tissue maintenance, growth, angiogenesis, disease progression, and; immunology. In vitro models Of the BM (e.g., Boyden and transwell chambers) are common in cell biology and lab-on-a-chip devices where cells require apical and basolateral polarization. Extravasation, intravasation, membrane transport of chemokines, cytokines, chemotaxis of cells, and other key functions are routinely studied in these models. The goal of the present study was to integrate a semipermeable ultrathin polymer membrane with precisely positioned pores of 2 mu m diameter in a microfluidic device with apical and basolateral chambers. We selected poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), a, transparent biocompatible polymer, to prepare the semipermeable ultrathin membranes. The pores were generated by pattern transfer using a three-step method coupling femtosecond laser machining, polymer replication, and spin:coating. Each step of the fabrication process was characterized by scanning electron microscopy to investigate reliability of the process and fidelity of pattern transfer. In order to evaluate the compatibility of the fabrication method with organs-on-a-chip technology, porous PLLA membranes were embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices and used to grow human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) on top of the membrane with perfusion through the basolateral chamber. Viability of cells, optical transparency of membranes and strong adhesion of PLLA to PDMS were observed, thus confirming the suitability of the prepared membranes for use, in organs-on-a-chip devices.',\n",

The rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology allows one to explore gene expression heterogeneity among single-cells, thus providing important cancer cell evolution information. Single-cell DNA/RNA sequencing data usually have low genome coverage, which requires an extra step of amplification to accumulate enough samples. However, such amplification will introduce large bias and makes bioinformatics analysis challenging. Accurately modeling the distribution of sequencing data and effectively suppressing the bias influence is the key to success variations analysis. Recent advances demonstrate the technical noises by amplification are more likely to follow negative binomial distribution, a special case of Poisson distribution. Thus, we tackle the problem CNV detection by formulating it into a quadratic optimization problem involving two constraints, in which the underling signals are corrupted by Poisson distributed noises. By imposing the constraints of sparsity and smoothness, the reconstructed read depth signals from single-cell sequencing data are anticipated to fit the CNVs patterns more accurately. An efficient numerical solution based on the classical alternating direction minimization method (ADMM) is tailored to solve the proposed model. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method Using both synthetic and empirical single-cell sequencing data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance and high promise of success with single-cell sequencing data.

       " {'text': 'As human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) begins to replicate within hosts, immune responses are elicited against it. Escape mutations in viral epitopes immunogenic peptide parts presented on the surface of infected cells allow HIV to partially evade these responses, and thus rapidly go to fixation. The faster they go to fixation, i.e., the higher their escape rate, the larger the selective pressure exerted by the immune system is assumed to be. This relation underpins the rationale for using escapes to assess the strength of immune responses. However, escape rate estimates are often obtained by employing an aggregation procedure, where several mutations that affect the same epitope are aggregated into a single, composite epitope mutation. The aggregation procedure thus rests upon the assumption that all within-epitope mutations have indistinguishable effects on immune recognition. In this study, we investigate how violation of this assumption affects escape rate estimates. To this end, we extend a previously developed simulation model of HIV that accounts for mutation, selection, and recombination to include different distributions of fitness effects (DFEs) and inter mutational genomic distances. We use this discrete time Wright Fisher based model to simulate early within-host evolution of HIV for DFEs and apply standard estimation methods to infer the escape rates. We then compare true with estimated escape rate values. We also compare escape rate values obtained by applying the aggregation procedure with values estimated without use of that procedure. We find that across the DFEs analyzed, the aggregation procedure alters the detectability of escape mutations: large-effect mutations are overrepresented while small-effect mutations are concealed. The effect of the aggregation procedure is similar to extracting the largest-effect mutation appearing within an epitope. Furthermore, the more pronounced the over-exponential decay of the DFEs, the more severely true escape rates are underestimated. We conclude that the aggregation procedure has two main consequences. On the one hand, it leads to a misrepresentation of the DFE of fixed mutations. On the other hand, it conceals within-epitope interactions that may generate irregularities in mutation frequency trajectories that are thus left unexplained.',\n",

Previous studies focus on first-order analysis for performance evaluation, which is appropriate only when the observation noise is small so that the bias is insignificant compared to variance. Further studies indicate that the first-order analysis does not appear sufficient in explaining and predicting the performance of an estimator for the fitting problem, especially when the noise level becomes significant. This paper extends the previous study to perform the second-order analysis and evaluate the estimation bias of several concentric circle estimators. The second-order analysis exposes important characteristics of the estimators that cannot be seen from the first-order studies. The insights gained in the theoretical study have led to the development of a new estimator that is unbiased and performs best among the algebraic solutions.

Efficient memory resource management requires knowledge of the memory demands of applications or systems at runtime. A widely proposed approach is to construct a miss ratio curve (MRC) for a VM, which not only summarizes the current working set size (WSS) of the VM but also models the relationship between its performance and the target memory allocation size. Unfortunately, the cost of monitoring and maintaining the MRC structures is nontrivial. This article first introduces a low-cost WSS tracking system with effective optimizations on data structures, as well as an efficient mechanism to decrease the frequency of monitoring. We also propose a Memory Balancer (MEB), which dynamically reallocates guest memory based on the predicted WSS. Our experimental results show that our prediction schemes yield a high accuracy of 95.2% and low overhead of 2%. Furthermore, the overall system throughput can be significantly improved with MEB, which brings a speedup up to 7.4 for two to four VMs and 4.54 for an overcommitted system with 16 VMs.',\n",

Therefore, the incorporation of such technologies in education became frequent, enabling a number of innovative and exciting experiences for the achievement of learning in various fields of knowledge. Within this scenario, Distance Learning (DL) is highlighted as a type of education that thrives on technological advances and on sharp integration of human with computers and computer systems. Distance Learning has broadened horizons mainly in adult education within undergraduate, graduate, and professionalization area. For example, for professionals with intense work journeys, that face difficulties to join continuing education, the facilities offered by distance learning such as flexible working hours and place for studies represent a solution. In health area, such initiatives have grown considerably due to all these advantages. In Brazil, the government has focused on Distance Learning to offer continuing medical education for professionals within the public health care network through the Open University of the Brazilian National Health System (UNA-SUS), which works in partnership with public universities in several states. In Maranhao, with the support of the Federal University from that State (UFMA), UNA-SUS has developed various mechanisms and educational tools to facilitate learning through Distance Learning. Among them, it is possible to highlight educational electronic games, created by the institution to provide realistic and interactive study experiences, seeking to integrate specific play activities to make learning more dynamic, creative and fun. These games were developed because they are able to provide a motivating and attractive atmosphere for teaching by simulating practical situations, encouraging development of strategies and solutions, and decision-making, therefore contributing for the construction of concepts and psychomotor function stimulation. The games developed by UNA-SUS/UFMA match the storytelling genre, following comic book format, using the player interaction to complete the story.

We investigated the rate of remission (UAE= 300 mg/gCr; overt proteinuria) 36 months after study registration. Results: The number of patients whose UAE levels were= 300 mg/gCr (DN progression) at 36 months after registration was 32 (13.7%).

Despite the remarkable progress in the development of tools and algorithms, the \"exhaustive\" extraction of information from these metabolomic datasets is still a non-trivial undertaking. A conversation on data mining strategies for a maximal information extraction from metabolomic data is needed. Using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomic dataset, this study explored the influence of collection parameters in the data pre-processing step, scaling and data transformation on the statistical models generated, and feature selection, thereafter. Data obtained in positive mode generated from a LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomic study (sorghum plants responding dynamically to infection by a fungal pathogen) were used. Raw data were pre-processed with MarkerLynx (TM) software (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). Here, two parameters were varied: the intensity threshold (50-100 counts) and the mass tolerance (0.005-0.01 Da). After the pre-processing, the datasets were imported into SIMCA (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for more data cleaning and statistical modeling. In addition, different scaling (unit variance, Pareto, etc.) and data transformation (log and power) methods were explored. The results showed that the pre-processing parameters (or algorithms) influence the output dataset with regard to the number of defined features. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the pre-treatment of data prior to statistical modeling affects the subspace approximation outcome: e.g., the amount of variation in X-data that the model can explain and predict. The pre-processing and pre-treatment steps subsequently influence the number of statistically significant extracted/selected features (variables). Thus, as informed by the results, to maximize the value of untargeted metabolomic data, understanding of the data structures and exploration of different algorithms and methods (at different steps of the data analysis pipeline) might be the best trade-off, currently, and possibly an epistemological imperative.',\n",

Although various modern trackers have impressive performance, some challenges such as occlusion and target scale variation are still intractable, especially in the complex scenarios. This paper proposes a robust scale adaptive tracking algorithm to predict target scale by a sequential Monte Carlo method and determine the target location by the correlation filter simultaneously. By analyzing the response map of the target region, the completeness of the target can be measured by the peak-to-sidelobe rate (PSR), i.e., the lower the PSR, the more likely the target is being occluded. A strict template update strategy is designed to accommodate the appearance change and avoid template corruption. If the occlusion occurs, a retained scheme is allowed and the tracker refrains from drifting away. Additionally, the feature integration is incorporated to guarantee the robustness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both the distance precision and overlap precision on the publicly available TB-50 dataset.',\n",

Recently, developed screening methods have allowed the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the identification of traits that are difficult to identify at the molecular level by conventional breeding. With the assistance of reverse genetic techniques, sequence variation information can be linked to traits to investigate gene function. Targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) is a high-throughput technique to identify single nucleotide mutations in a specific region of a gene of interest with a powerful detection method resulted from chemical-induced mutagenesis. The main advantage of TILLING as a reverse genetics strategy is that it can be applied to any species, regardless of genome size and ploidy level. However, TILLING requires laborious and time-consuming steps, and a lack of complete genome sequence information for many crop species has slowed the development of suitable TILLING targets. Another method, high-resolution melting (HRM), which has assisted TILLING in mutation detection, is faster, simpler and less expensive with non-enzymatic screening system. Currently, the sequencing of crop genomes has completely changed our vision and interpretation of genome organization and evolution. Impressive progress in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has paved the way for the detection and exploitation of genetic variation in a given DNA or RNA molecule.

Family stress was assessed by a psychometrically evaluated instrument comprising five items on, e.g., familial conflicts or domestic workload. Asthma was operationalized by self-reports of a physician diagnosis. Associations were examined by multivariable logistic regression estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Women with combined exposure (versus none) had somewhat higher odds of asthma (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.42-3.19) than those with sole exposure to either work stress (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.20-2.96) or family stress (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.03-2.84).

It has been concluded that the degree of vascular calcification may vary from person to person, even if the associated pathologies and environmental factors are the same.

Neutrophil infiltration of the kidney was significantly higher after AKI in wild-type mice than in MMP-8 null mice, starting at 4 days. Additionally, MMP-8 null mice subjected to AKI demonstrated a persistent histopathologic and functional injury and worsened health (greater overall weight loss) versus wild-type cohorts after seven days. Taken together, our findings suggest that MMP-8 is involved with restoration of baseline kidney health after ischemic kidney injury and that a potential mechanism involves the interaction of MMP-8 and neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury.',\n",

We determined the association between EH and hospitalizations for all natural causes; cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases; diabetes mellitus; and acute myocardial infarction in Michigan, USA, at different intensities and durations. We assessed confounding by ozone and how individual characteristics and health insurance payer (a proxy for income) modified these associations. We obtained Michigan Inpatient Database, National Climatic Data Center, and US Environmental Protection Agency ozone data for May-September, 2000-2009 for three Michigan counties. We employed a case-crossover design and modeled EH as an indicator for temperature above the 95th, 97th, or 99th percentile thresholds for 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. We examined effect modification by patient age, race, sex, and health insurance payer and pooled the county results. Among non-whites, the pooled odds ratio for hospitalization on EH (97th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH days for renal diseases was 1.37 (95 % CI = 1.13-1.66), which increased with increasing EH intensity, but was null among whites (OR = 1.00, 95 % CI = 0.81, 1.25). We observed a null association between EH and cardiovascular hospitalization. EH (99th percentile threshold) was associated with myocardial infarction hospitalizations. Confounding by ozone was minimal. EH was associated with hospitalizations for renal disease among non-whites. This information on vulnerability to heat-associated morbidity helps characterize the public health burden of EH and target interventions including patient education.',\n",

We determined the overall incidence of second primary lung cancer after previous RT for all clinical stages of BC. Methods: After an analysis of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, 986,713 individuals were randomly enrolled from 2000 to 2010 for cohort analysis. All women with newly diagnosed invasive BC, aged 18 years or older, and without other types of malignancy before 2000 or in the follow-up periods were enrolled and allocated to the RT or non-RT groups. Age, comorbidities, insurance premium, urbanization level, location, date of event, and hospital care level were analyzed. The hazard ratios of parameters were calculated by Cox regression analysis. Results: A total of 7408 individuals met the inclusion criteria, including 5695 patients with BC who underwent RT and 128 (2.25%) in whom lung cancer developed. In contrast, lung cancer was diagnosed in only four of 1713 individuals in the non-RT group (0.23%) during the followup period. Cox regression analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratio was 10.078 times higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group for individuals with previous BC. Conclusions: The incidence of second primary lung cancer was significantly higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group for individuals with previous BC. Patients with BC treated by RT should be extensively surveyed to assess the incidence of subsequent lung cancer. (C) 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Infants' cord blood was genotyped for CD14 (rs2569190), TLR4 (rs1927911), and GSDMB (rs4794820) polymorphisms by the TaqMan method. Higher prenatal intake of total fruit and vegetables (FV) was associated with the decreased risk of RTI in offspring (P-trend=0.0430). In children with TT genotype at rs2569190, a higher prenatal intake of vitamins A and C, fruits, and total FV decreased RTI risk (P-trend < 0.05), while in infants with TC+CC genotype, a higher prenatal intake of fruit increased RTI risk (P-trend < 0.05). When analyzing the 3 genotypes, children with TT genotype at rs2569190 were more protected against RTIs compared with those with CC genotype with respect to vitamin C and fruits [odds ratio (OR)=5.04 and OR=10.30, respectively]. In children with CC genotype at rs1927911, RTI risk showed a dose-response association with a higher prenatal intake of vitamin C (P for interaction < 0.05). A higher prenatal intake of fruits and total FV reduced RTI risk in infants with GA+AA genotype of rs4794820 (P for interaction < 0.05).

Hence, efficient model-based perceptual metrics, operating on the geometry of the meshes being compared, have been recently introduced to control and predict these visual artifacts. However, since the 3D models are ultimately visualized on 2D screens, it seems legitimate to use images of the models (i.e., snapshots from different viewpoints) to evaluate their visual fidelity. In this work we investigate the use of image metrics to assess the visual quality of 3D models. For this goal, we conduct a wide-ranging study involving several 2D metrics, rendering algorithms, lighting conditions and pooling algorithms, as well as several mean opinion score databases. The collected data allow (1) to determine the best set of parameters to use for this image-based quality assessment approach and (2) to compare this approach to the best performing model-based metrics and determine for which use-case they are respectively adapted. We conclude by exploring several applications that illustrate the benefits of image-based quality assessment.',\n",

Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research. We will describe the system's design and the considerations made during the design process, and demonstrate the system by conducting three user evaluations, all of which have been published before in the visualization literature.\",\n",

It involves involuntary eyelid spasms, eye closure, and increased blinking. Despite the success of botulinum toxin injections and, in some cases, pharmacologic or surgical interventions, BEB treatments are not completely efficacious and only symptomatic. We could develop principled strategies for preventing and reversing the disease if we knew the pathogenesis of primary BEB. The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual framework and dynamic circuit hypothesis for the pathogenesis of BEB. The framework extends our overarching theory for the multifactorial pathogenesis of focal dystonias (Peterson et al., 2010) to incorporate a two-hit rodent model specifically of BEB (Schicatano et al., 1997). We incorporate in the framework three features critical to cranial motor control: (1) the joint influence of motor cortical regions and direct descending projections from one of the basal ganglia output nuclei, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, on brainstem motor nuclei, (2) nested loops composed of the trigeminal blink reflex arc and the long sensorimotor loop fromtrigeminal nucleus through thalamus to somatosensory cortex back through basal ganglia to the same brainstem nuclei modulating the reflex arc, and (3) abnormalities in the basal ganglia dopamine system that provide a sensorimotor learning substrate which, when combined with patterns of increased blinking, leads to abnormal sensorimotor mappings manifest as BEB. The framework explains experimental data on the trigeminal reflex blink excitability (TRBE) from Schicatano et al. and makes predictions that can be tested in new experimental animal models based on emerging genetics in dystonia, including the recently characterized striatal-specific D1R dopamine transduction alterations caused by the GNAL mutation. More broadly, the model will provide a guide for future efforts to mechanistically link multiple factors in the pathogenesis of BEB and facilitate simulations of how exogenous manipulations of the pathogenic factors could ultimately be used to prevent and reverse the disorder.',\n",

Recent findings Much of our understanding of the physiological roles of SR-B1 and PDZK1 in HDL metabolism and atherosclerosis comes from studies of genetically manipulated mice. These show SR-B1 and PDZK1 play key roles in HDL metabolism and protection against atherosclerosis. The recent identification of rare loss of function mutations in the human SCARB1 gene verifies that it plays similar roles in HDL metabolism in humans. Other rare mutations in both the human SCARB1 and PDZK1 genes remain to be characterized but may have potentially devastating consequences to SR-B1 function. Summary Identification of carriers of rare mutations in human SCARB1 and PDZK1 that impair the function of their gene products and characterization of the effects of these mutations on HDL cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis will add to our understanding of the importance of HDL function and cholesterol flux, as opposed to HDL-cholesterol levels, per se, for protection against cardiovascular disease.',\n",

The system has been developed for use in a firefighting robot for close-range, localized fire suppression tasks in enclosed environments. A probabilistic water classification method was developed for segmenting water spray in a pair of IR cameras. Stereo processing was performed to localize points along the spray path for use in yaw and pitch angle estimation. A Golden Section Search with linear least squares optimization was used to determine the optimal pitch angle of the spray position at each sampling time. Kalman filtering was used to remove noise from the angle measurements and obtain a better estimate of the current nozzle orientation. A decision tree was used to determine the correct nozzle positioning mode using image feedback to suppress the fire and accounts for errors in direction, fire size during suppression, and when to adjust the nozzle based on IR feedback. Through implementation of a PI controller, the system is able to correct for unknown disturbances causing erroneous targeting of a localized fire. Experiments are presented with the initial nozzle angled correctly and with forced offsets in the system to set the initial spray position incorrectly in order for the system to correct. Suppression times ranged from 7.2 s to 16.3 s with a standard deviation of 3.9 s and average time of 11.2 s. A total of 12 tests demonstrated performance of the system given a forced offset to the initial nozzle orientation resulting in an error between the spray location and the fire target. Suppression times ranged from 8.1 s to 27.9 s with a mean of 16.9 s and standard deviation of 6.2 s. The proposed system can be implemented on a robotic firefighting platform to autonomously detect a fire, choose a proper manipulation goal and suppress full scale fires given disturbances causing erroneous targeting.',\n",

Human obesity is a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. Objectives To investigate the possible association of weight loss on plasma and renal biomarkers of kidney health. Animals Thirty-seven obese dogs that lost weight were included in the study. Methods Prospective observational study. Three novel biomarkers of renal functional impairment, disease, or both (homocysteine, cystatin C, and clusterin), in addition to traditional markers of chronic renal failure (serum urea and creatinine, urine specific gravity [USG], urine protein-creatinine ratio [UPCR], and urine albumin corrected by creatinine [UAC]) before and after weight loss in dogs with naturally occurring obesity were investigated. Results Urea (P=.043) and USG (P=.012) were both greater after weight loss than before loss, whilst UPCR, UAC, and creatinine were less after weight loss (P=.032, P=.006, and P=.026, respectively).

Decision aids are tools commonly used to discuss important information in health care settings. To address this knowledge gap, we designed this study to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid at promoting informed shared decision making (ISDM) between patients and providers related to ESA use for CKD- and ESRD-related anemia. Methods: Using the principles of informed shared decision making theory, we designed and piloted an ESA decision aid intended to increase CKD and ESRD patient understanding of the potential risks and benefits of ESAs. Informed by the findings during development, the ESA decision aid was modified and finalized for testing. We will perform a randomized clinical trial to assess if administration of the ESA decision aid improves patient understanding of the risks and benefits of ESA use compared to control patients receiving standard care. Participants with either CKD or ESRD and who are receiving ESAs will be eligible for participation. The primary outcome is patients' score on the Patient Anemia Knowledge in Kidney Disease (PAKKD) survey assessed at enrollment and 3 months after. Secondary outcomes include decisional conflict related to ESAs, and patient satisfaction with provider communication. Discussion: The Anemia Risk Communication for patients with Kidney Disease (ARC-KD) study will assess the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid to improve patient understanding of ESA use to manage CKD-and ESRD-related anemia.

Targeting cohesive-clusters takes advantage of the known ability of extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion to promote tumor cell survival and represents an approach that has the potential to avoid the progression to drug- and radiotherapy-resistance. In the following review we will examine the evidence for development and dissemination of cohesive-clusters in metastatic prostate cancer. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Three subsets can be distinguished among them: myeloid-biased (alpha), balanced (beta), and lymphoid-biased (gamma/delta) hematopoietic stem cells. The ratio of these hematopoietic stem cell subsets is developmentally regulated in the foetal liver and hematopoietic stem cells adult bone marrow, and coordinately gives rise to hematopoiesis. Beta- and gamma/delta-hematopoietic stem cells are found predominantly early in the life of an organism, whereas a-hematopoietic stem cells accumulate in aged mice and humans. In addition, new sophisticated genetic experiments in mice have identified a major role of long-lived, committed progenitor cells downstream from hematopoietic stem cells as drivers of normal adult hematopoiesis, and revealed that post-transplantation hematopoiesis differs qualitatively and quantitatively from normal steady-state hematopoiesis.

To cope with unpredictable rainfall, African annual killifish from temporary savannah pools lay drought-resistant eggs that vary widely in the duration of embryo development. We examined the sources of variability in the duration of individual embryo development, egg production and fertilization rate in Nothobranchius furzeri. Using a quantitative genetics approach (North Carolina type II design), we found support for maternal effects rather than polyandrous mating as the primary source of the variability in the duration of embryo development. The number of previously laid eggs appeared to serve as an internal physiological cue initiating a shift from rapid-to-slow embryo developmental mode. In annual killifish, extensive phenotypic variability in progeny traits is adaptive, as the conditions experienced by parents have limited relevance to the offspring generation. In contrast to genetic control, with high phenotypic expression and heritability, maternal control of traits under natural selection prevents standing genetic diversity from potentially detrimental effects of selection in fluctuating environments.',\n",

A popular VIV model (Van der Pol-type model) for bridge decks is examined in detail. Alternatively, a truncated Volterra series-based nonlinear oscillator is introduced to model the VIV system. Typical features of VIV such as the limit cycle oscillation (LCO), frequency shift, hysteresis, and beat phenomenon are parsimoniously and accurately captured in the proposed nonlinear model. As a functional expansion of a nonlinear system, the Volterra series is convenient for estimating the linear and nonlinear contributions to VIV. It is demonstrated that the relative contribution of nonlinear effects in VIV is around 50% of the total response for a range of bridge cross sections.

Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). Methods: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. Conclusions: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.',\n",

To investigate the impact of pre-and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012. Participating mothers were asked to report on household pet ownership at recruitment during the second or third trimester and 3 months postpartum. Infant gut microbiota were profiled with 16S rRNA sequencing from faecal samples collected at the mean age of 3.3 months.

Results: Over half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods. As a common effect in all birth scenarios, pre-and postnatal pet exposure enriched the abundance of Oscillospira and/or Ruminococcus (P < 0.05) with more than a twofold greater likelihood of high abundance. Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P < 0.001, FDRp = 0.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95% CI, 0.06-0.70) for pet exposure during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95% CI, 0.16-0.58) for exposure in the pre-and postnatal time periods. All of these associations were independent of maternal asthma/allergy status, siblingship, breastfeeding exclusivity and other home characteristics.

Modem approaches of DNA/RNA sequencing open the possibility to obtain detailed sequence information from individual genomes and transcriptomes at single nucleotide resolution. Further studies tried to correlate genetic variability with important biological consequences such as the risk for developing a disease or defining a personalized approach towards therapy (also called \"personalized or precision medicine\").

Biological significance: The manuscript focuses on a recent trend in proteomics, namely the integration of genomic and proteomic data. Genetic and transcriptomic variability accounts for a considerable part of protein variability and is at the basis of many protein species, many of which not yet described at the protein level but many also identified as proteins or peptides with unknown function.

We tested this hypothesis using four readouts: proliferation, activation, functional suppression, and signaling. Results showed that Tregs were less susceptible to inhibition by both and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors and by an MEK inhibitor compared with their conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) counterparts. These studies suggest less functional reliance on PI3K and MEK signaling in Tregs compared with conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes. Therefore, the PI3K and MEK pathways are attractive pharmacologic targets for transplantation and treatment of autoimmunity. In vitro agents that block the PI-3 kinase and/or MEK pathways preferentially block nonregulatory T cells, relatively sparing regulatory T cells, suggesting that these pathways may be attractive targets in transplantation.',\n",

       " {'text': 'DNA-based individual identification and RNA-based tissue identification represent two commonly-used tools in forensic investigation, aiming to identify crime scene sample donors and helping to provide links between DNA-identified sample donors and criminal acts. Currently however, both analyses are typically performed separately. In this proof-of-principle study, we developed an approach for the simultaneous analysis of forensic STRs, amelogenin, and forensic mRNAs based on parallel targeted DNA/RNA sequencing using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (R) (PGM (TM)) System coupled with the AmpliSeq (TM) targeted amplification. We demonstrated that 9 autosomal STRs commonly used for individual identification (CSF1PO, D16S539, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, TH01, TPOX, and vWA), the AMELX/AMELY system widely applied for sex identification, and 12 mRNA markers previously established for forensic tissue identification (ALAS2 and SPTB for peripheral blood, MMP10 and MMP11 for menstrual blood, HTN3 and STATH for saliva, PRM1 and TGM4 for semen, CYP2B7P1 and MUC4 for vaginal secretion, CCL27 and LCE1C for skin) together with two candidate reference mRNA markers (HPRT1 and SDHA) can all be successfully combined. Unambiguous mRNA-based tissue identification was achieved in all samples from all forensically relevant tissues tested, and STR sequencing analysis of the tissue sample donors was 100% concordant with conventional STR profiling using a commercial kit. Successful STR analysis was obtained from 1 ng of genomic DNA and mRNA analysis from 10 ng total RNA; however, sensitivity limits were not investigated in this proof-of-principle study and are expected to be much lower. Since dried materials with noticeable RNA degradation and small DNA/RNA amplicons with high-coverage sequencing were used, the achieved correct individual and tissue identification demonstrates the suitability of this approach for analyzing degraded materials in future forensic applications. Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously obtaining multilocus STR, amelogenin, and multilocus mRNA information for combined individual and tissue identification from a small sample of degraded biological material. Moreover, our study marks the first step towards combining many DNA/RNA markers for various forensic purposes to increase the effectiveness of molecular forensic analysis and to allow more forensically relevant information to be obtained from limited forensic material.

Isolated suction holes are arranged on the lower surface of the test model in spanwise direction, and based on previous studies of similar bluff body, a proper distance of spanwise suction was chosen to trigger or amplify the most unstable secondary instability (i.e. Mode A) in wake. The simulation results show that the suction arranged close to the wake has the best control effect on reducing the fluctuating aerodynamic forces. Due to the mean-velocity modification by isolated spanwise suction, the virtual aerodynamic shape modification is generated, which could act as spanwise perturbation to suppress spanwise vortexes. The results indicate that the spanwise suction could trigger or amplify the Mode A instability, and hence lead to the dislocation of the spanwsie vortex or even completely suppress the spanwise vortex. In addition, the spanwise suction control can surpress spanwise vortex shedding in a wide Re range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Monte-Carlo simulations are a well-established methodology to numerically assess the effect of variations of both mechanical and aerodynamic parameters on the aeroelastic stability of a suspended bridge. In this research paper we use this statistical approach to present a design methodology for the assessment of long span aeroelastic behavior that considers not only the flutter velocity as a unique safety index, as it is common practice, but also the trend of the total damping as a function of the wind velocity. Specifically, several significant in-service conditions are considered. Indeed, wind velocities at in-service conditions are events with a probability much higher than flutter condition, and in these cases a reliability analysis represents an added value in the design process. Therefore the statistical analysis of total damping at in service conditions is suggested as a useful tool to judge the performance of a structure especially for those structures where the wind-structure interaction represents the capital aspect of the overall design as it happens for the very long span bridges. Given the probability distribution of the input parameters, the Monte Carlo simulations allows one to statistically investigate the aeroelastic stability of the structure, in terms of range of variation of the total damping and flutter velocity, through an eigenvalue analysis. It is also possible to state the probability of not matching the design technical specification and the probability of being in a certain prescribed variation band. The mathematical and statistical background of the design methodology are presented and a case of study is analyzed with reference to the Messina Straits Bridge. The test case was chosen to stress the methodology with a challenging design, where extreme structural and aerodynamic solutions are implemented to reach a main span length of 3300 m and where the performances of the structure are deeply bounded to the reliability of the aeroelastic design.

This study was designed to mimic midlife menopause, followed by E2 treatment, that either followed or exceeded the current clinical recommendations. Female Long-Evans retired breeders were ovariectomized (OVX) at 11 mo of age and randomized into three groups: 80-day (80d) vehicle (Veh >Veh), 40-day (40d) E2 + 40d vehicle (E2 >Veh), and 80d E2 (E2 >E2). In comparison to Veh >Veh, both the E2 >Veh and E2 >E2 groups had lower systolic blood pressure and enhanced mesenteric relaxation in response to estrogen receptor-alpha stimulation. Despite the reduced blood pressure, E2 >E2 induced renal and cardiac hypertrophy, reduced glomerular filtration, and increased proteinuria. Interestingly, kidneys from E2 >Veh rats had significantly fewer tubular casts than both of the other groups. In conclusion, long-term E2 lowered blood pressure but exerted detrimental effects on kidney health in midlife OVX Long-Evans rats, whereas short-term E2 lowered blood pressure and reduced renal damage.

Because many introns are known to affect gene expression, it is necessary to understand the molecular process(es) by which introns may be gained. Here we review the seven most commonly purported mechanisms of intron gain and, when possible, summarize molecular evidence for or against the occurrence of each of these mechanisms. Furthermore, we catalogue indirect evidence that supports the occurrence of each mechanism.

Importantly, melatonin significantly influences T-cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial to protect mammals against cancers and infections, but are associated with pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. This review focuses on our current understanding of the significance of melatonin in T-cell biology and the beneficial effects of melatonin in T-cell response-based diseases. In addition to expressing both membrane and nuclear receptors for melatonin, T cells have the four enzymes required for the synthesis of melatonin and produce high levels of melatonin. Meanwhile, melatonin is highly effective in modulating T-cell activation and differentiation, especially for Th17 and Treg cells, and also memory T cells. Mechanistically, the influence of melatonin in T-cell biology is associated with membrane and nuclear receptors as well as receptor-independent pathways, for example, via calcineurin. Several cell signaling pathways, including ERK1/2-C/EBP alpha, are involved in the regulatory roles of melatonin in T-cell biology. Through modulation in T-cell responses, melatonin exerts beneficial effects in various inflammatory diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis.

Using this analog multiplexing method, the 20 signals (16 position, 4 timing) from the PS-SSPM array are reduced to 5 signals (4 position, 1 timing), allowing the PS-SSPM array to be treated as an individual large-area PS-SSPM module. A global positioning approach can now be used, instead of individual positioning for each PS-SSPM in the array, ensuring that the entire light signal is utilized. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and flood histogram quality at different bias voltages (27.5 V to 32.0 V at 0.5 V intervals) and a fixed temperature of 0 degrees C were evaluated by coupling a 6 x 6 array of 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm x 20 mm polished LSO crystals to the center of the PS-SSPM array. The timing resolution was measured at a fixed bias voltage of 31.0 V and a fixed temperature of 0 degrees C. All the measurements were evaluated and compared using capacitors with different values and tolerances. Capacitor values ranged from 0.051 nf to 10 nf, and the capacitance tolerance ranged from 1% to 20%. The results show that better performance was achieved using capacitors with smaller values and better capacitance tolerance. Using 0.2 nf capacitors, the SNR, energy resolution and timing resolution were 24.3, 18.2% and 8.8 ns at a bias voltage 31.0 V, respectively.

These studies showed that the high spatial resolution of the PS-SSPM was preserved allowing for 0.7 mm crystals to be identified.

In this paper, a new calculation method for strand tension is explored by using dynamic balance theory to determine the effect of bending rigidity and boundary conditions. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested and confirmed with verification examples and application on Nanxi Yangtze Suspension Bridge in China. The results indicated that only low-order frequency calculation could be used to calculate the strand tension without considering the effect of bending rigidity to ensure control accuracy. The influence of bending rigidity on the control precision is related to the tension and the length of the strands, which is significantly determined by the specific value between the stress rigidity and the bending rigidity. The uncertain boundary conditions of the anchor span cable, which are fixed between consolidated and hinged, also have a major effect on the control accuracy.

We assessed brain glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67) protein levels, as a GABA-ergic marker, in the F2 and F3 generations. Results: Already in the Fl generation of male mice, but not females, it was possible to discriminate between clozapine-responders and non-responders. The rate of responders within each consecutive generation, increased. The increase was more pronounced in females. Up-regulation of GAD67 levels was detected between F2 and F3 only in male clozapine-responder mice, but not in females. Conclusions: This preliminary proof-of-concept study succeeded in producing a trans-generation enrichment of clozapine-responsiveness trait in a hypo-glutamatergic animal model of negative signs of schizophrenia. This model may serve as a platform to better characterize the clozapine responsiveness trait and offer a model for clozapine-responsive schizophrenia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the particle electrodes exhibit an excellent charge performance despite the electrode material layer being relatively thick and highly porous. The electrochemical reactor contained 20 single cells stacked together with 30 A h of nickel hydroxide and 15 A h of metal hydride as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical tests showed that the stack exhibited a high hydrogen production efficiency with a maximum current efficiency of 95.3% for hydrogen production and a hydrogen evolution amount per unit input electrical energy of 259.1 mL/W h at 0.2 C. At high current densities (2.0 C), a rapid temperature increase was also observed during the charging process, which led to a reduction of the hydrogen production efficiency.

Then, their cocrystallization behaviors were systematically investigated by DSC, WAXD, and POM techniques. It is found that both PHGP and PHPA showed isodimorphism with a characteristic eutectic behavior observed from the plot of melting point versus composition, however, PHGA exhibited strict isomorphism in the whole composition range without a eutectic point. WAXD studies also confirmed the unique isodimorphism and isomorphism behaviors for even-odd copolyesters. The only slight change of the methylene number in alkyl unit of comonomers could generate so large difference in crystallization behavior, which exhibits unique physicochemical properties and structure-properties correlations in such even-odd copolyesters. Furthermore, the difference in cocrystallization miscibility effect of comonomers was analyzed by thermodynamics based on the defect Gibbs energy calculated from Wendling-Suter model. For PHGP and PHPA, the comonomer units have better miscibility in the case of the incorporation of shorter unit into the longer unit crystal than the opposite case. By contrast, in the case of PHGA, the HG and HA units are perfectly miscible in a same crystal lattice with only a little difference in crystal cell dimensions due to the identity of chain conformation of HG and HA units during packing into the crystal lattice. Finally, a model of crystal lattice structure of copolyesters was proposed to better understand the difference in cocrystallization miscibility effect of comonomers between isodimorphism and isomorphism.

This is the first study of its kind conducted in Turkey. Methods: First, ICAST was translated into Turkish by bilingual experts. Students and their parents were asked to complete ICAST-C and ICAST-P respectively, with the help of trained researchers. In total, data from 2,608 matched reports (2,608 children and 2,608 parents) was obtained. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate demographical variables, and chi-square tests were employed to investigate the statistical significance of comparisons. Results: The present study demonstrated that Turkish parents consider rebukes, insults and corporal punishment effective ways of disciplining children. According to parents' reports, the use of psychological abuse was most prevalent against boys aged 16, while the use of physical abuse was most prevalent against boys aged 13. A statistically significant relationship was found between parents' economic conditions and child abuse (p0.05). However, the relationship between paternal educational background and psychological abuse was observed to be significant (p < 0.05). A comparison of children's and parents' reports shows that parents tended to under-report child maltreatment.

In the LS-SVMAT, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is integrated with an adaptive time function (ATF) to generalize the inputoutput mapping of cash flow. Since cash flow data are time-dependent, data points recorded in different periods can contribute dissimilarly to the training process of the prediction model. Thus, the role of the ATF is to determine the appropriate weight associated with each data point at a specific time period.

For many years, numerous studies have reported the optimal swimming of flagellar organisms. Nevertheless, there is still a question as to which is optimal among planar, circular helical and ellipsoidal helical beating. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to investigate the beat pattern with the best swimming efficiency based on hydrodynamic dissipation and internal torque exertion. For the parameters considered, our results show that the planar beat is optimal for small heads and the helical flagellum is optimum for a larger heads, while the ellipsoidal beat is never optimal. Also, the genetic optimization reveals that the wavenumber and shape of wave envelope are relevant parameters, whereas the wave shape and head geometry have relatively minor effects on efficiency. The optimal beat with respect to the efficiency based on the internal torque exertion of an active elastic flagellum is characterized by a small-wave number and large-amplitude wave in a lower-viscosity medium. The obtained results on the optimal waveform are consistent with observations for planar waveforms, but in many respects, the results suggest the necessity of a detailed flagellar structure-fluid interaction to address whether real spermatozoa exhibit hydrodynamically efficient swimming.

The C18-BSA phase simultaneously excluded macromolecules by chemical diffusion barrier (BSA network) and enrichment of the interior phase (C18) with drug traces by sorption. The hydrophilic barrier of the Cl 8-BSA allows small molecules (drugs) to permeate through the hydrophobic part (C18), while at the same time it excludes the macromolecules by chemical diffusion barrier (BSA network). Optimization of the DPX variables (sorption equilibration time, exclusion of endogenous compounds, and elution step) improved the sensitivity and selectivity of the method, which presented a linear range from the lower limit of quantification (0.5-20.0 ng mL(-1)) to the upper limit of quantification (32.5-10,500 ng mL(-1)), inter- and intra-assay precision with coefficients of variation (CV) lower than 15%, and relative standard error (RSE) of the accuracy ranging from -12% to 11%.

In the literature, many detection schemes have been proposed to detect NTL frauds. However, some NTL frauds are far more complicated than what the existing schemes expect. We recently discovered a new potential type of frauds, a variant of NTL frauds, called Colluded Non-Technical Loss (CNTL) frauds in the Smart Grid. In a CNTL fraud, multiple fraudsters can co-exist or collaborate to commit the fraud. Existing detection schemes cannot detect CNTL frauds since these methods do not consider the co-existing or collaborating fraudsters, and therefore cannot distinguish one from many fraudsters. In this paper, we propose a CNTL fraud detector to detect CNTL frauds. The proposed method can quickly detect a tampered meter based on recursive least squares. After identifying the tampered meter, the proposed scheme can detect different fraudsters using mathematical models. Our experiments show that our method is effective in detecting CNTL frauds.

It has often been suggested that reducing waste to the landfill does not only require improvement on existing waste management policies and fiscal framework; there is a need for adequate inputs from the construction professionals. As a means of engendering effective waste management policies, this study explores industry practitioners' viewpoints on effective policies for minimising waste landfilled by the UK construction industry. Using exploratory sequential mixed method approach, qualitative and quantitative methods were used. In the first phase of the study, data was collected through focus group discussions with 24 experts from the UK construction industry. Findings from the qualitative study served as an input into a questionnaire, which was used to elicit a wider opinion from 63 experts at the quantitative stage of the study. The study suggests that for waste management legislation and policies to effectively drive construction waste minimization, six key measures are important. These include (i) provision of tax breaks and incentives to good waste performers and waste management businesses; (ii) increased targeting of design stages in policies; (iii) Extension of sustainable design appraisal systems by allocating more points to proven waste performance measures; (iv) increased stringency of legislative measures by requiring use of proven waste efficient design, procureMent and construction methods; (v) increased stringency of fiscal policies by increasing penalties for poor waste performance; and (vi) corroboration of policy requirements with enablers and facilitators. The strategies through which each of the legislative and fiscal measures could be tailored and enhanced are discussed in the paper. By embracing both Stringent and palliative policy measures suggested in the study, substantial construction waste could be diverted from landfill. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\n",

Significance: Poor bioavailability of PPZ necessitated the development of fast-dissolving PPZ formulations regardless of delivery routes. Existing fast-dissolving formulations, however, exhibited low PPZ payload. The high-payload PPZ-DXT nanoplex represents an attractive fast-dissolving formulation, as dissolution rate is known to be proportional to payload. Methods: The nanoplex was prepared by electrostatically driven complexation between PPZ and DXT in a simple process that involved only ambient mixing of PPZ and DXT solutions. We investigated the effects of key variables in drug-polyelectrolyte complexation (i.e. pH and charge ratio R-DXT/PPZ) on the physical characteristics and preparation efficiency of the nanoplex produced. Subsequently, we characterized the colloidal and amorphous state stabilities, dissolution enhancement, and supersaturation generation of the nanoplex prepared at the optimal condition. Results: The physical characteristics of nanoplex were governed by R-DXT/PPZ, while the preparation efficiency was governed by the preparation pH. Nanoplex having size of approximate to 80nm, zeta potential of approximate to(-) 60mV, and payload of approximate to 70% (w/w) were prepared at nearly 90% PPZ utilization rate and approximate to 60% yield. The nanoplex exhibited superior dissolution than native PPZ in simulated intestinal juice, resulting in high and prolonged apparent solubility with good storage stabilities. Conclusions: The simple yet efficient preparation, excellent physical characteristics, fast dissolution, and high apparent solubility exhibited by the PPZ-DXT nanoplex established its potential as a new bioavailability enhancement strategy of PPZ.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Marangoni convection in a volatile liquid film subject to a horizontal temperature gradient confined in a rectangular cavity is a basic problem of heat transfer and fluid mechanics with applications in evaporative cooling. The Marangoni stresses that drive this flow are due to surface tension gradients at the liquid-vapor interface. The thermocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with temperature for the most part drive the liquid away from hot regions. A volatile binary-fluid mixture can, however, be designed so that the solutocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with concentration drive the liquid instead towards hot regions, and hence oppose thermocapillary stresses. In thicker liquid layers, the flow is also affected by buoyancy. This work details an experimental study of buoyancy-Marangoni convection in a similar to 0.31 cm deep layer of methanol-water (MeOH-H2O) in a sealed rectangular cuvette driven by a temperature difference of similar to 6 degrees C over a horizontal distance of 4.9 cm. Particle pathline visualizations and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) were used to study this flow and determine how the liquid composition, quantified in terms of the MeOH concentration C-M, and noncondensables (i.e., air), quantified by the concentration of air in the gas space above the liquid c(a), affect the flow. Solutocapillary effects are strong enough to drive the liquid near the free surface towards the heated end over the entire horizontal extent of the liquid layer at low ca (i.e., c(a) < 6%), suggesting that binary-fluid coolants could significantly reduce film dryout. This flow, driven by thermocapillarity, solutocapillarity and buoyancy, is classified into four distinct flow regimes that are summarized in a ca vs. CM flow regime map. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since clinical heterogeneity and complexity of schizophrenia is high, considerable effort has been made to relate genetic variants to underlying neurobiological aspects of schizophrenia (endophenotypes). Given the polygenic nature of schizophrenia, our goal was to form a measure of additive genetic risk and explore its relationship to cortical morphology. Utilizing the data from a recent genome-wide association study that included nearly 37 000 cases of schizophrenia, we computed a polygenic risk score (PGRS) for each subject in 2 independent and healthy general populations. We then investigated the effect of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on cortical gyrification calculated from 3.0T structural imaging data in the discovery dataset (N = 315) and replication dataset (N = 357). We found a consistent effect of the polygenic risk for schizophrenia on cortical gyrification in the inferior parietal lobules in 2 independent general-population samples. A higher PGRS was significantly associated with a lower local gyrification index in the bilateral inferior parietal lobles, where case-control differences have been reported in previous studies on schizophrenia. Our findings strongly support the effectiveness of both PGRSs and endophenotypes in establishing the genetic architecture of psychiatry.

Smart home scheduling is usually implemented in a decentralized fashion inside a smart community, where customers compete for the community level renewable energy due to their relatively low prices. Typically there exists an aggregator as a community wide electricity policy maker aiming to minimize the total electricity bill among all customers. This paper develops a new renewable energy aware pricing scheme to achieve this target. We establish the proof that under certain assumptions the optimal solution of decentralized smart home scheduling is equivalent to that of the centralized technique, reaching the theoretical lower bound of the community wide total electricity bill. In addition, an advanced cross entropy optimization technique is proposed to compute the pricing scheme of renewable energy, which is then integrated in smart home scheduling. The simulation results demonstrate that our pricing scheme facilitates the reduction of both the community wide electricity bill and individual electricity bills compared to the uniform pricing. In particular, the community wide electricity bill can be reduced to only 0.06 percent above the theoretic lower bound.',\n",

Using the ratio of pure constituent molar surface areas and a parameter named surface factor, which depends only on pure constituent properties, the Butler equation is expressed and solved as a function of these two independent parameters. The geometrical features for the plots of surface tension against the mole fraction of component with lower surface tension are established for every possible combination of those two parameters. Three main shape types are found, namely: concave up (positive curvature); concave down passing through an inflection point followed by concave up; and concave down (negative curvature). The range of parameter values leading to each shape type is obtained and shown graphically. It is demonstrated that Butler's ideal model excludes the eventuality of a system presenting a shape with initial positive curvature, then an inflection point and continuing with negative curvature. All the above shapes will appear as a mirror image in the representation of surface pressure against mole fraction. Six organic organic systems, including two ionic liquid solutions, taken from the literature are examined. It is shown that actual Gibbs adsorption isotherm shapes arise from the sum of ideal surface tension deviations with excess surface tensions, the latter being related to the equilibrium surface/bulk ratio of activity coefficients. It is also shown that this ratio is larger for the component with the greatest molar surface area. From the comparison of surface and bulk activity coefficients at the same chemical composition interesting insights into the surface phase are drawn.\",\n",

The design is inexpensive and simple to assemble in large numbers, enabling genuine replication of even highly complex, many treatment study designs. For example, it is possible to simultaneously examine in replicate chambers the responses of organisms to constant regimes, regimes that fluctuate following the means experienced by populations and regimes that exactly mimic fluctuations measured over any length of time for particular individuals that differ in behaviour or microhabitat use.

The influences of the external resistance, concentration of phosphate buffer, and electrode spacing in soil MFCs on the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were analyzed. The results showed that the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were increased when the external resistance decreased from 2000 to 20 (1, and also when the concentration of phosphate buffer increased. The anode area played a significant role in dechlorination of HCB. Altering the spacing of the reducing electrode resulted in a lower ohmic resistance in the soil MFCs.

       " {'text': 'Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a behavioral test in which the startle reflex response to a high-intensity stimulus (pulse) is inhibited by the prior presentation of a weak stimulus (prepulse). The classic neural circuitry that mediates startle response is localized in the brainstem; however, recent studies point to the contribution of structures involved in higher cognitive functions in regulating the sensorimotor gating, particularly forebrain regions innervated by dopaminergic nuclei. The aim of the present study was to verify the role of dorsal striatum (DS) and dopaminergic transmitting mediated by D1 and D2 receptors on PPI test in rats. DS inactivation induced by muscimol injection did not affect PPI (%PPI and startle response), although it impaired the locomotor activity and caused catalepsy. Infusion of D1-like antagonist SCH23390 impaired %PPI but did not disturb the startle response and locomotor activity evaluated immediately after PPI test. D2 antagonist microinjection (sulpiride) did not affect %PPI and startle response, but impaired motor activity. These results point to an important role of DS, probably mediated by direct basal ganglia pathway, on modulation of sensorimotor gating, in accordance with clinical studies showing PPI deficits in schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, and compulsive disorders - pathologies related to basal ganglia dysfunctions.',\n",
