According to the USGBC projects' directory, there are only Six LEED Certified projects and 17 registered projects in Egypt. This implies the limited number of LEED projects in Egypt. That's why most of the empirical studies conducted about LEED Rating System were performed on other markets than the Egyptian one; Accordingly This paper is the result of a longitudinal study that was performed on Three Egyptian LEED Certified projects as a part of a master thesis research that was submitted to Cairo University in 2013 by the first author where the second and the third author were the main supervisors. The objective of this study was to investigate the implementation of the LEED Rating system credits in Egypt through a comparative analysis of Three Egyptian LEED Certified projects. The results of this study included a classification for the most achieved and targeted credits within the Egyptian market. This study may also contribute to a better understanding of the concept of implementing LEED green building rating system in Egypt and may suggest some recommendations for future studies.
