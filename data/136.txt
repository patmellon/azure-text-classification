Project owners are very important project participants involved in the delivery of green building projects. By virtue of their commitment, or owner commitment (OC), they can ensure successful delivery of green building projects. However, the indicators of OC are yet to be identified in the literature. As a result, information and knowledge of how OC leads to the successful delivery of green building projects is currently unknown. Therefore, this study carried out a systematic literature of review of 47 scholarly publications in the area of project delivery of green building projects to identify the indicators of OC. Findings reveal 9 indicators of OC, with varying degrees of importance depending on their frequency in the reference sources. The study concludes that there are 9 important indicators of OC. Additionally, the indicators can influence project performance such cost, time, quality and sustainability rating metrics, thereby ensuring successful delivery of green building projects. The findings in this study have implications for project owners of green building projects. Therefore a framework of implementation of OC was proposed. Project owners can apply the framework to guide their commitment from selection of project participants at the design stage to encouragements for improved performance at the construction stage in a sequential manner. Future research should explore and confirm the factor structure of the indicators of OC in order to identify their underlying relationships. In addition, the use and effectiveness of the framework of OC should be validated by utilizing it for practical delivery of green building projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
