Drinking non-bovine milk has been reported to possess bio-functionality for regular consumers. Camel milk is a traditional product that has been used for many years in arid rural communities of Asia and Africa as a biomedicine to cure several health issues such as asthma, oedema, and diabetes. The product consists of appropriate amounts of bioactive compounds. In addition, it contains low amounts of fatty acids and cholesterol, whilst it does not contain beta-lactoglobulin. The latter, which is present in bovine milk, causes allergic symptoms in some people. The similarity of the formula to human milk suggests this superfood as an alternative for bovine milk with complete nutrition for infants. In this review, the biomolecules present in camel milk and their positive roles on the health of consumers are extensively discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
