Conceptual seismic design is a qualitative design for seismic performance of the structure, and the corresponding design is the quantitative design based on seismic response analysis. The qualitative conceptual design is more reliable than the quantitative numerical design to long-span arch bridges, because there are many uncertainties in the quantitative seismic response analysis. The typical earthquake damage and the cause of the damage for long-span arch bridges are presented at home and abroad. The general requirements of conceptual seismic design for long-span arch bridge are discussed from the aspects of engineering site selection, reasonable bridge structure system and layout scheme and foundation form. The design principles avoiding brittle failure for long span arch bridges are given from the use of high strength materials, improving the overall ductility, setting up redundancy elements and multi seismic defense lines. Main components and secondary members of the structure are divided, seismic capacity of main component and secondary member are different design. Seismic conceptual design method is proposed. The general requirements, design principles and design methods are also applied to the long span cable-stayed bridge and suspension bridge.
