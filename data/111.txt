A model is proposed for calculating the composition of GaAsxP1-x solid solutions, based on the iterative determination of the equilibrium partial pressures of the pyrolysis products of the starting reagents, followed by calculation of the composition of the solid solution in an adsorption-desorption model. The proposed model ensures good agreement between calculation results and experimental data.
