Unmanned aerial vehicles have become more widely used for entertainment, security, building inspection and for other similar tasks. Inertial Navigations Systems (INS) is one of the main area of research for UAVs to control their flights through buildings or near constructions where flight paths must be controlled or recorded. In this paper is collected some approaches, which can be used for UAV onboard trajectory determination where GPS cannot be used are determined. Approach includes onboard inertial measurement unit system and image sensors. Fusing UAVs controlling methods and computer vision gives possibility to increase inertial navigation system accuracy. To determine distance to obstacles dual vision cameras must be used. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
