A non-uniform C-section phaser is introduced as a powerful approach to enhance the design flexibility of uniform phasers. Moreover, an efficient synthesis technique is provided to design such phasers. Two design examples are presented. The first example is a single non-uniform C-section phaser. The second one is a cascaded double non-uniform C-section phaser featuring larger group delay swing and bandwidth, and hence higher resolution in Radio Analog Signal Processing (R-ASP).
