With the advancement of power electronics, new materials and novel bearing technologies, there has been an active development of high speed machines in recent years. The simple rotor structure makes switched reluctance machines (SRM) candidates for high speed operation. This paper has presents the design of a low power, 50,000 RPM 6/4 SRM having a toroidally wound stator. Finite element analysis (FEA) shows an equivalence to conventionally wound SRMs in terms of torque capability. With the conventional asymmetric converter and classic angular control, this toroidal-winding SRM (TSRM) is able to produce 233.20 W mechanical power with an efficiency of 75% at the FEA stage. Considering the enhanced cooling capability as the winding is directly exposed to air, the toroidal winding is a good option for high-speed SRM.
