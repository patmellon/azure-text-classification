A full software radio receiver is supposed to receive any signals in a wide band within a range from 0 to 5 GHz. But, linearity constraints are very strong because of all the non-idealities of such a complex system. Those non-idealities generate some undesired signals (interferers) leading to a degradation of reception. They can be counteracted by compensation. This paper proposes a mixed system of wide-band linearization consisting in an analog spectral sensor (SASP), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and an analog compensation signal generator. High-level simulation results in VHDL-AMS language exhibits a rejection of 60dB for continuous wave (CW) interferers.
