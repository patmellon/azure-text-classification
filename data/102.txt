It is a measure of the dynamic performance of the machine tool design merits of the important performance indicators. This paper use Pro/E and ANSYS Workbench integrated development platform, for a certain type of grinder bed for three-dimensional modeling and modal analysis to improve dynamic performance, and based on the results of the various parts of the structure size and internal ribs rational layout optimization and design, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the camshaft grinding machine design.
