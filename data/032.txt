A closed-form iterative procedure for synthesizing quasi-arbitrary phase responses with cascaded microwave C-section all-pass phasers is presented. The synthesis consists in mapping the transmission poles of the cascaded C-section structure onto the transmission poles of the specified transfer function, where the latter poles are computed using a closed-form polynomial generation method. The real and complex transmission poles of the specified transfer function are realized using C-sections of different lengths and different couplings coefficients. The proposved synthesis is validated by both full-wave analysis and measured multilayer prototypes. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
