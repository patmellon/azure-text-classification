Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate the association between hypertension and physical/functional capacities in community-dwelling older females.Materials and methods: Older female volunteers were dichotomized in two groups: hypertensive (n=134) and normotensive (n=244). Volunteers had their medical records reviewed and underwent evaluations of anthropometric data (weight, height and body mass index) and of physical and functional capacities.Results: The results showed that hypertensive older females presented higher values for age, weight, body mass index, and resting diastolic blood pressure than normotensive older females. Normotensive older females showed a higher performance in the one-leg stand test and six-minute walk test compared with hypertensive older females. Age, body mass index, maximal walking speed, performance in the Time Up and Go and six-minute walk test, and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II were factors associated with hypertension using the chi-square test. However, the multivariate regression analysis indicated that performance in the six-minute walk test was the only factor associated with hypertension.Conclusions: The patients with higher scores in the six-minute walk test, which is associated with aerobic capacity, show less odds to have clinical diagnosis of hypertension. However, hypertension was not associated with poor physical and functional capacity.
