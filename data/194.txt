For decades, developing hematopoietic cells have been strictly compartmentalized into a small population of multipotent self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells that are undergoing commitment to myeloid or lymphoid fates, and unipotent precursor cells that mature towards peripheral blood and immune cells. Recent studies, however, have provided a battery of findings that cannot be explained by this "classical" hierarchical model for the architecture of hematopoiesis. It is emerging that heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell populations in the bone marrow coexist, each with distinct, preprogrammed differentiation and proliferation behaviors. Three subsets can be distinguished among them: myeloid-biased (alpha), balanced (beta), and lymphoid-biased (gamma/delta) hematopoietic stem cells. The ratio of these hematopoietic stem cell subsets is developmentally regulated in the foetal liver and hematopoietic stem cells adult bone marrow, and coordinately gives rise to hematopoiesis. Beta- and gamma/delta-hematopoietic stem cells are found predominantly early in the life of an organism, whereas a-hematopoietic stem cells accumulate in aged mice and humans. In addition, new sophisticated genetic experiments in mice have identified a major role of long-lived, committed progenitor cells downstream from hematopoietic stem cells as drivers of normal adult hematopoiesis, and revealed that post-transplantation hematopoiesis differs qualitatively and quantitatively from normal steady-state hematopoiesis. These findings have important implications for understanding in situ the regulation of haematopoiesis in health and disease.
