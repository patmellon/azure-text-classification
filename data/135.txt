Installed capacity of solar photovoltaic and small size wind turbine at the residential microgrid gains promising growth in most developed countries. However, uncertain characteristic of intermittence and volatility is still one of significant factors to affect the effective operation, it should be well-conducted in the design of these distributed renewable resources. After considering household requirement of reliability and energy utilization, implicit behavior of the meteorological uncertainty has been managed by stochastic time series weather data to satisfy the objectives in planning of hybrid renewable generation system installed at residential customers. Some load management strategies are conducted to improve the energy utilization of green building with renewable power in the planning stage. The proposed simulation framework realizes the optimal installed capacity of residential renewable generation with storage device to achieve more effective energy utilization in future green building.
