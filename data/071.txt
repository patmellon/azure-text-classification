Embodiment has become the central topic of ritual studies. Over recent decades a great deal has changed in the comprehension of ritual, its nature and the main characteristics. This knowledge can become of benefit for liturgy research. Interpreting of ritual is based on an understanding of physical acts, gestures and attitudes. We also find both dimensions expressed in liturgy by the term attitudes physical and mental, as well as the occurrences of a deep embodiment of attitudes in liturgy. Most signification in liturgy takes place in something other than a verbal way. Nonverbal communication is not often dealt with, however, reflected in the liturgy science. The text aims at an analysis of certain approaches, which help in an understanding of the nature of a liturgical act, which is always essentially a ritual act.
