In this paper, the DDES (Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation) is applied to study the spanwise suction control effect on wind-induced effect of a static bridge deck. Isolated suction holes are arranged on the lower surface of the test model in spanwise direction, and based on previous studies of similar bluff body, a proper distance of spanwise suction was chosen to trigger or amplify the most unstable secondary instability (i.e. Mode A) in wake. The simulation results show that the suction arranged close to the wake has the best control effect on reducing the fluctuating aerodynamic forces. Due to the mean-velocity modification by isolated spanwise suction, the virtual aerodynamic shape modification is generated, which could act as spanwise perturbation to suppress spanwise vortexes. The results indicate that the spanwise suction could trigger or amplify the Mode A instability, and hence lead to the dislocation of the spanwsie vortex or even completely suppress the spanwise vortex. In addition, the spanwise suction control can surpress spanwise vortex shedding in a wide Re range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
