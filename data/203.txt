Background: Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a severe ocular disorder that presents early in life. Cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) and latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein 2 (LTBP2) are the most commonly mutated genes in PCG. Aim: To investigate the causative genetic mutations in eight Indian families with PCG. Materials and Methods: Whole-exome sequencing was applied to analyze the genomic DNA samples from PCG probands. Sanger sequencing was utilized to confirm the identified mutations. Results: We identified four homozygous missense mutations (c.1405C>T, p.R469W; c.1397G>T, p.G466V; c.1198C>T, p.P400S; and c.1103G>A, p.R368H) in CYP1B1 and one nonsense mutation (c.2421G>A, p.W807X) in LTBP2 in eight Indian families. Among the five mutations identified, G466V in CYP1B1 and W807X in LTBP2 represent novel mutations. Conclusions: Our study expands the mutational spectrum of PCG in the Indian population.
