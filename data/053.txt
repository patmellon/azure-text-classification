A compact 24-GHz Doppler radar module is developed in this paper for non-contact human vital-sign detection. The 24-GHz radar transceiver chip, transmitting and receiving antennas, baseband circuits, microcontroller, and Bluetooth transmission module have been integrated and implemented on a printed circuit board. For a measurement range of 1.5 m, the developed radar module can successfully detect the respiration and heartbeat of a human adult.
