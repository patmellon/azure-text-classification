The main purpose of this research aims design a vacuum for removal of brain tumors with disconnectors microdestruccion and integrated control system. The development of the project is to remove most of the tumor brain and thus improve the standard of living of the patient. For this design it developed different types of cutting tools, thus obtaining a disconnector for other hard tissue and soft tissue. On the other hand, it was designed using vacuum techniques and fluid mechanics, suction cannulae which consist of a small metal nozzle be in direct contact with the patient. Then, a system of open loop control which monitor and control system variables suction, pumping irrigation fluid and level control in the tanks of tumor material, in order to obtain a computer user friendly designed. It was subsequently verified by the simulator Automation Studio 3.0.5, operation of the control system and finally an analysis of technical and economic feasibility obtaining the final solution is feasible for implementation in the country was conducted.
